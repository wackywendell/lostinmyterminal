I am a computational physicist at Yale University, studying a range of systems in the fields of biophysics and granular materials.

I am also an Open-Source enthusiast, and I maintain a few useful packages:

 - [Tess](http://tess.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) ([repository](https://github.com/wackywendell/tess)): Calculate 3D Voronoi tesselations in Python
 - [Spack](http://spack.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) ([repository](https://github.com/wackywendell/spack)): Analyze packings of spheres
 - [ParM](http://parm.lostinmy.com/) ([repository](https://github.com/wackywendell/parm)): A feature-packed Molecular Dynamics simulation package, modularly built to support just about any MD simulation (2D or 3D). I have used it myself for jamming (packings of spheres), disordered protein simulations, and modeling bird nests. It is written in C++ and includes bindings for Python.

I have also contributed to many larger projects, including numpy, Rust, vapory, and others.
