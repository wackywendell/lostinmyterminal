# About Me

I am a computational physicist at Yale University, studying a range of systems from the fields of biophysics to granular materials. 

I am also an Open-Source enthusiast, and I maintain a few useful packages:

 - [Tess](http://tess.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) ([repository](https://github.com/wackywendell/tess)): Calculate 3D Voronoi tesselations in Python
  - [Spack](http://spack.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) ([repository](https://github.com/wackywendell/spack)): Analyze packings of spheres
  
I have also contributed to many larger projects, including numpy, Rust, vapory, and others.
