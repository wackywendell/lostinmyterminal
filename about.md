# About this Blog

Like many in the software community, I routinely come across simple things that I either frequently forget how to do or that even with a bit of searching take a while to compose a full answer. This blog exists to help me remember these in the future, and hopefully to help any other wayward souls searching for similar answers.

# About Me

I am a computational physicist at Yale University, studying a range of systems from the fields of biophysics to granular materials.
