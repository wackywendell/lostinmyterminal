# Welcome

Like many in the software community, I routinely come across simple things that I either frequently
forget how to do or that even with a bit of searching take a while to compose a full answer. This
blog exists to help me remember these in the future, and hopefully to help any others lost in their
own terminals searching for similar answers.

## About Me

## Posts

There are a few posts I think are especially useful for most terminal users:

  * [BASH and `getopts`]({% post_url 2015-02-06-getopts %})
  * [Prepending and appending to your `$PATH`]({% post_url 2015-01-09-path-prepend %})
  * [Using Sphinx for documentation]({% post_url 2015-03-09-sphinx-documentation %})

Or read [other posts](posts).
