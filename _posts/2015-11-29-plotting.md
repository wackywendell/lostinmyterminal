The Python `matplotlib` module is a very complete (if somewhat inelegant) way to
plot just about any data you could want. Here's a short list of things Matplotlib can do:

 - Handle large amounts of data
 - Save to PNG, SVG, PDF, or many other formats
 - Produce plots programmatically or semi-interactively
 - Have subplots in any form you want
 - Have LaTeX in titles, subtitles, axes labels, even tick labels
 - Have semi-transparent objects

However, the defaults for `matplotlib` are not particularly aesthetically pleasing. Here is an example of some data plotted with the default settings:


{% highlight python %}
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(xs, ys)
ax.legend(loc='lower left')
ax.set_title('Qualitatively Different Lines')
ax.set_xlabel('This is the x-axis')
ax.set_ylabel('Random but decaying values')
{% endhighlight %}

The colors are ugly, the lines are thin, and, well, it could be worse, but it could also be a lot better.

There are a number of libraries out there that provide "upgrades" to the default
styles and/or provide more options for more styles or colors
([Palettable](https://jiffyclub.github.io/palettable/) provides some lovely
schemes), but I just wanted a straightforward style that would "just work". I
took the 9 colors from the ColorBrewer 2.0  ["Set1"
scheme](http://colorbrewer2.org/?type=qualitative&scheme=Set1&n=9), and set them
as the default palette. Combining that with some thicker lines gives a much prettier plot, in my opinion:


{% highlight python %}
import mutedcolors
# Use the "muted" style I created
style.use('stylelib/muted.mplstyle')
... # (Plot like above)
{% endhighlight %}

I also created a rainbow-like colormap from this palette that goes green-blue-purple-red-orange, and created a function that will generate N colors to pair with N lines, and this allows for nice sequential plotting:

{% highlight python %}
# Register new colormaps from the `mutedcolors` package
mutedcolors.new_cmaps()
# Iterate over data sets and colors at the same time, pulling colors from the
# new "grormute" (i.e., green-orange-muted) color map
for n,color,y in mutedcolors.eczip(ys.T, cmap='grormute', start=1):
    ax.plot(xs, y, color=color, label='Plot %s' % n)
... # add axes labels, legend, etc. like above
{% endhighlight %}

## Smaller Plots for Better Presentation

Another thing I've found is that, surprisingly, using a smaller figure size for your plots makes them more presentable. The reason for this is that it
