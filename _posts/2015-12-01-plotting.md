*Note:* The configurations, code, and images in this post are all available on GitHub at [this repository](https://github.com/wackywendell/mutedplots/), with a Jupyter notebook available [here](https://github.com/wackywendell/mutedplots/blob/master/prettyplots.ipynb).

The Python `matplotlib` module is a very complete (if somewhat inelegant) way to
plot just about any data you could want. Here's a short list of things Matplotlib can do:

 - Handle large amounts of data
 - Save to PNG, SVG, PDF, or many other formats
 - Produce plots programmatically or semi-interactively
 - Have subplots in any form you want
 - Have LaTeX in titles, subtitles, axes labels, even tick labels
 - Have semi-transparent objects

However, the defaults for `matplotlib` are not particularly aesthetically pleasing. Here is an example of some data plotted with the default settings:


{% highlight python %}
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(xs, ys)
ax.legend(loc='lower left')
ax.set_title('Qualitatively Different Lines')
ax.set_xlabel('This is the x-axis')
ax.set_ylabel('Random but decaying values')
{% endhighlight %}

The colors are ugly, the lines are thin, and, well, it could be worse, but it could also be a lot better.

There are a number of libraries out there that provide "upgrades" to the default
styles and/or provide more options for more styles or colors
([Palettable](https://jiffyclub.github.io/palettable/) provides some lovely
schemes), but I just wanted a straightforward style that would "just work". I
took the 9 colors from the ColorBrewer 2.0  ["Set1"
scheme](http://colorbrewer2.org/?type=qualitative&scheme=Set1&n=9), and set them
as the default palette. Combining that with some thicker lines gives a much prettier plot, in my opinion[^style][^config]:


{% highlight python %}
import mutedcolors
# Use the "muted" style I created (see below for installation)
style.use('stylelib/muted.mplstyle')
... # (Plot like above)
{% endhighlight %}

![qualitative plot]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/mutedplots/imgs/qualitative.svg)

[^style]: To use my styles (`muted` or `small`), you can either download them
    into some folder, and access them with
    `style.use('/path/to/muted.mplstyle')`, or you can download them into
    `$HOME/.config/matplotlib/stylesheet`, and then access them with
    `style.use('muted')`.

[^config]:  If `$HOME/.config/matplotlib/stylesheet` does not exist, 
    you may need to create it. Similarly, `$HOME/.config/matplotlib` is the
    default location for the matplotlib config directory on  OSX or Linux; if
    its not there (or you're on Windows), you can  find it with
    `matplotlib.get_configdir()`. See [the
    documentation](http://matplotlib.org/users/style_sheets.html)  for more
    details.


I also created a rainbow-like colormap from this palette that goes green-blue-purple-red-orange, and created a function that will generate N colors to pair with N lines, and this allows for nice sequential plotting:

{% highlight python %}
# Register new colormaps from the `mutedcolors` package
mutedcolors.new_cmaps()
# Iterate over data sets and colors at the same time, pulling colors from the
# new "grormute" (i.e., green-orange-muted) color map
for n,color,y in mutedcolors.eczip(ys.T, cmap='grormute', start=1):
    ax.plot(xs, y, color=color, label='Plot %s' % n)
... # add axes labels, legend, etc. like above
{% endhighlight %}

## Smaller Plots for Better Presentation

Another thing I've found is that, surprisingly, using a smaller figure size for
your plots makes them more presentable. The reason for this is that the axes,
labels, and lines correspondingly _increase_ in size relative to the size of the
figure. While I may already know exactly what the axes are and want to
concentrate on the data in the graph, the audience / reader need to be able to
see the axes themselves and read them. Here is an example:

{% highlight python %}
with style.context('stylelib/small.mplstyle'):
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    for n,color,y in mutedcolors.eczip(ys.T, cmap='grormute', start=1):
        ax.plot(xs, y, color=color, label='Plot %s' % n)
{% endhighlight %}

## Using Transparency

Another thing that can really make a lot of data more readable and more
aesthetically pleasing is a good use of transparency. Let's imagine each line in
our data is actually the _median_ of 20 different runs, and we want to show the
variability in all these runs. We could plot each previous run as a full line,
but this will get very busy... unless we use a narrower line with some
transparency, so that it mostly fades into the background and leaves the median
lines in the foreground. Here is an example:

{% highlight python %}
for n,color,yset in mutedcolors.eczip(ys.T, cmap='grormute', start=1):
    ax.plot(xs, yset, 
            color=color,
            linewidth=1, 
            linestyle='-',
            alpha=1.5 / N_in_set)
    ax.plot(xs, np.median(yset, axis=-1),
            color=color,
            label='Plot %s' % n,
            linewidth=3,
            linestyle='-',
            alpha=1.0)
{% endhighlight %}

## Summary

#### Use thicker lines and good colors. 

My 
    [muted](https://github.com/wackywendell/mutedplots/blob/master/stylelib/muted.mplstyle)
    style has some good defaults that I use.

I like my `grormute` color map, and have a function for taking series of 
    lines and a color map and "zipping" them together. See 
    [here](https://github.com/wackywendell/mutedplots/blob/master/mutedcolors.py).

For more choices, see [palettable](https://jiffyclub.github.io/palettable/),
    although it can be overwhelming.

#### For presentations and papers, use a smaller figure size. 

This makes it easier for an audience member to read the axes labels.

An example style for that is 
    [here](https://github.com/wackywendell/mutedplots/blob/master/stylelib/small.mplstyle).

#### Use transparency to give some data prominence over others.
